                        Ahit4me and our analytics partners use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and
                        scripts to enable a service to recognize your device so you don't have to provide the same
                        information several times during one task, recognize that you may have already given a username
                        and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested, and to measure how people
                        are using the Products.

                        We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties
                        with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Products also use HTML5 to collect and
                        store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

                        We partner with third parties, such as Facebook and Google, to manage our advertising of the
                        Products on other sites or platforms as well as across your other devices based on your past
                        visits to our website. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather

                        do-not-track signals. For more information about interest-based ads, including how to opt-out of
                        having your web-browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit
                        www.aboutads.info/choices. Please note that this does not opt you out of being served ads. You

                        receiving ads across devices by adjusting your ad preference in your Google account.

                        We use third party trackers to let us know when users have visited the Products by
                        “clicking-through” our sponsored advertising or content hosted on third party platforms. The
                        Products use Google Analytics code to gather statistical information. Google Analytics sets
